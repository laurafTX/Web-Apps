# Web-Apps
Web Apps created using HTML, JS, CSS, etc...
The most basic of READMEs should still include a few main pieces of information.
Title — What is your app/project called?
Overview — Why did you start this project?
Features — What are some key things your project can do?
Running the project — How could someone else get your code working for them?
Dependencies — What are the main outside resources your project needs to run?
